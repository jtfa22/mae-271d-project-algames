UCLA MAE 271D Spring 2025 project 


Run sim.ipynb to run the ALGAMES solver in an example configuration.
Run mpc.ipynb to run the MPC wrapped ALGAMES solver in an example configuration.

The example configuration is currently set to the "lane-merge" example as detailed in the Homework 2 assignment.

Initial and final states (x, y, vx, vy), as well as weights on the cost and convergence criteria can be tuned in blocks 2 and 3 at the top of each .ipynb file.
